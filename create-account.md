# Creating an Indico Account (with/without Shibboleth)

---

##  Scenario:

> **You** are a university lecturer planning to organize or attend the **"National Research Conference 2025"** hosted via Indico by LEARN.
>
> You want to access the conference site, register, submit an abstract, or even manage the event as an organizer.
>
> To do this, you must first **create an Indico account** — either by logging in through your **institution (EduID)** or by **registering manually**.

---

##  Option A: Create an Account with Shibboleth (EduID)

> Recommended for users from Sri Lankan universities connected to LEARN’s federated identity system.

###  Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to the Indico portal**
   Example: [https://indico.learn.ac.lk](https://events.learn.ac.lk)

2. Click **Login** (top-right)
   <div style="width: 150px"><img src="https://github.com/LEARN-LK/Indico/blob/main/img/sso-login-01.png"</div>

4. Select **Login using your institution**

   > You will be redirected to: `https://idp.learn.ac.lk`

5. Select your university from the dropdown (if prompted)

6. Login with your **institutional email/password** (EduID)

7. If this is your first time:

   * You’ll be redirected back to Indico
   * Click **“Create new Indico profile”**
   * Your name and email will be filled automatically
   * Fill in any missing info (e.g., affiliation)

8. Click **Create Profile** 

> From now on, you will log in with your university account — no password needed for Indico itself.

---

##  Option B: Manual Account Registration (No Shibboleth)

> Use this if you're an external participant or your university is not in EduID.

###  Step-by-Step:

1. Visit the Indico portal
   e.g., [https://indico.learn.ac.lk](https://indico.learn.ac.lk)

2. Click **Login**

3. Click **Create a new account** (below the login form)

4. Fill in the registration form:

   * First Name / Last Name
   * Email address
   * Username
   * Password
   * Affiliation (university/institute)

5. Click **Register**

6. Check your inbox for a **confirmation email**

7. Click the activation link to verify your email

 Now you can log in using your username and password.
