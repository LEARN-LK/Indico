###  Example Scenario:

For **NRC 2025**:

* When a participant registers, they receive:

  > *Subject: Thank You for Registering – NRC 2025*
  > *Dear {name},*
  > *Thank you for registering for the National Research Conference 2025. The event will be held on 10–12 December 2025...*

* When an abstract is accepted, the author receives:

  > *Subject: NRC 2025 – Abstract Accepted*
  > *Dear {name},*
  > *Your abstract titled "{title}" has been accepted. You are invited to present in Session 3 on Dec 11.*

---

###  

* **Double-check your placeholders** `{name}`, `{title}` for accuracy.
* **Test by sending to yourself** before launching a bulk email.
* **Keep tone professional** and clear. Avoid overloading with too much detail.
