####  Example:

> Dr. Silva from the University of Peradeniya selects "University of Peradeniya" from the institution list and logs in with his university email and password. His Indico account is created automatically.

---

## 02. Option B: Manual Account Registration (No Shibboleth)

> Use this if you're an external participant or your university is not in EduID.

####  Example:

> Prof. Lee, an invited reviewer from outside Sri Lanka, manually registers with his Gmail address and completes email verification. He is then added as an abstract reviewer for NRC 2025.
