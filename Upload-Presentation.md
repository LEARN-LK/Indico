##  **Part 3: K – Upload Presentation Files and Materials**

This section helps you upload **presentation slides, posters, papers, or supplementary materials** for each session or contribution in your Indico conference (e.g., NRC 2025). These files will be publicly visible to attendees (unless restricted) and accessible from the conference homepage. Speakers can also upload materials if granted permissions.
